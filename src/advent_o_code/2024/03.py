# The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are safe. The Red-Nosed reactor safety systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or gradually decreasing. So, a report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:

#     The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
#     Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.
